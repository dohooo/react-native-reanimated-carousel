# Migration Guide to v5.x

This guide will help you migrate your application from react-native-reanimated-carousel v4.x to v5.x.

## 🎯 What's New in v5.x

### Dynamic Sizing (Auto-sizing)
The biggest feature in v5.x is **automatic dimension calculation**. You no longer need to manually specify `width` and `height` props!

### Expo 54 Support
Full compatibility with Expo SDK 54 and the latest React Native ecosystem.

## 📦 Version Requirements

Before upgrading, ensure your project meets these version requirements:

```json
{
  "react": ">=18.0.0",
  "react-native": ">=0.80.0",
  "react-native-gesture-handler": ">=2.9.0",
  "react-native-reanimated": ">=4.0.0",
  "react-native-worklets": ">=0.5.0"
}
```

## 💥 Breaking Changes

### 1. React Native Reanimated v4

**Required:** Upgrade to `react-native-reanimated@^4.1.0`

```bash
npm install react-native-reanimated@^4.1.0
```

Follow the [Reanimated v4 migration guide](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/) for any breaking changes.

### 2. React Native Worklets (New Dependency)

**Required:** Install `react-native-worklets@^0.5.1`

```bash
npm install react-native-worklets@^0.5.1
```

This package is required by Reanimated v4 and replaces the deprecated `runOnJS` function with `scheduleOnRN`.

## ✨ New Features

### Dynamic Sizing

The most requested feature! Carousel now automatically measures container dimensions:

```tsx
// ✅ v5.x - Auto-sizing (beta)
<Carousel
  data={data}
  renderItem={renderItem}
  // width and height are now optional!
  // Carousel automatically measures container
/>

// ✅ v5.x - Still works (explicit sizing via style prop)
<Carousel
  style={{ width: 300, height: 200 }}
  data={data}
  renderItem={renderItem}
/>
```
